Description
===========

htmlout is a simple library that makes it really easy to build a tree of HTML
nodes and then to serialize this tree into text for final output.

This library really needs a rewrite, but I have a lot of code using it, and some
public code in Atocha uses it, so I thought I would open source it anyway.  If
you need it, here it is.


Features
--------

- Has an option to output a nicely indented output or compressed output;
- A simple interface;


History
-------

I have been using and refining this library for years, and although it is long
due for a rewrite, it still serves me well.  It has a fair amount of value, in
the sense that many issues related to browsers have been ironed out, for
example, avoiding outputting empty div tags.  Little details like that.


Documentation
=============

There is no documentation, read the source if you need it.
