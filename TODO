   htmlout: TODO

Long-standing things to be done...
==================================

- The API has to be cleaned up.

- We should consider using the stan interface, in order to be able to put the
  attributes before an element's contents.

- We should optimize the output by not relying on xml.dom.minidom, which is most
  likely wasteful and slower that it should be.
