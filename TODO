Template Class
==============

* A nice base template class that generates a HEAD, allows you to set the title,
  etc. should be provided here.


Long-standing things to be done...
==================================

- The API has to be cleaned up.

- We should consider using the stan interface, in order to be able to put the
  attributes before an element's contents.

- We should optimize the output by not relying on xml.dom.minidom, which is most
  likely wasteful and slower that it should be.
